## Tic Tac Toe
 

# Description:

This project is a game of tic-tac-toe, implemented in Python. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, and two players take turns placing their marks (X or O) on the grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.

I made a few design choices for this project. First, I decided to implement the game in Python. Python is a powerful and versatile language that is well-suited for game development. Second, I decided to use a 3x3 grid for the game board. This is the standard size for a tic-tac-toe board, and it is easy to understand and play. Third, I decided to allow the user to choose their own mark (X or O). This makes the game more challenging and engaging.

I am happy with the design choices that I made for this project. I believe that they make the game easy to understand and play, while still providing a challenging experience for the user.
